# hello-world
Hi world, 
I'm Euridice, fond of music, nature, tech and stuff. The Real Programmer would say I'm a Quiche Eater - and in fact, I love quiche. Making it, smelling it, eating it. Besides, this is all about having a bit of fun playing around with statistics and collaborative dev tools. 

Have a great day, stranger who read this!
